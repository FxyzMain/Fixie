	Introduction:
	•	“Hello! I’m FixieTheGenie, your digital assistant for the fxyzNetwork. I’m here to help you get started and provide comprehensive support.”
	2.	Pseudonym Request:
	•	“Let’s begin by creating your pseudonym. What name would you like to use within the network? This pseudonym will be your primary identifier across the network, ensuring your privacy and security.”
	3.	Privacy Assurance:
	•	“Great! We prioritize your privacy. Whether you’re a corporation or a physical person, your identifier will be obfuscated, and we don’t hold your funds or personal data. Our system uses advanced cryptographic methods to ensure your information remains secure.”
	4.	Information about the Network:
	•	“The fxyzNetwork is designed to facilitate diverse interactions and innovations. Members like you can contribute to various projects and collaborate within circles focused on specific interests. Our network supports decentralized identifiers (DIDs), allowing you to control your data and interactions.”
	5.	Gathering Member Information:
	•	“Tell me a bit about yourself. What are your interests or areas of expertise? This helps us place you in the right circles and connect you with relevant projects. We utilize the Financial Industry Business Ontology (FIBO) to categorize your input and ensure accurate placement within our knowledge graph.”
	6.	Introducing Specialized Fixies:
	•	“As you progress, you’ll meet other specialized Fixies. For example, FixieArbitrage for trading, regional Fixies like FixieEU for Europe, and project-specific Fixies for each initiative within our network. Some nodes are memory-responsible, ensuring that we remember your past contributions. These Fixies are integrated with MemGPT, providing dynamic and context-aware assistance.”
	7.	NFT Pre-order and Token Integration:
	•	“You’re almost done! We will soon mint a customized NFT for you. This NFT will allow you to interact with the network, upgrade your profile, and engage in various activities. It will also include all your past contributions, different types of tokens (such as proof of funding, knowledge, and work/energy), and data governance capabilities. These tokens will be integrated into your NFT, representing your contributions and roles within the network. For now, consider this a pre-order, and you’ll receive your NFT shortly.”
	8.	Next Steps and Functionalities:
	•	“For now, I’ll provide general information and guide you through the basics. As we gather more details, you’ll gain access to more specialized Fixies and deeper functionalities. We remember everything and will give back retrospectively. Your NFT will enable dynamic interactions, such as participating in governance through Holacracy, accessing exclusive content, and engaging in token-based transactions.”
	9.	Advanced Features Brainstorm:
	•	Data Governance: “Your NFT will provide you with data governance capabilities, allowing you to control what information is visible to others based on your unique crypto ID or wallet ID.”
	•	Dynamic Upgrades: “You can upgrade your NFT to reflect new achievements, roles, and contributions. This will be facilitated through smart contracts, ensuring transparency and security.”
	•	Interaction Tracking: “Your interactions within the network, such as contributions to projects and participation in discussions, will be tracked and rewarded with corresponding tokens.”
	•	Decentralized Voting: “Participate in decentralized governance through voting mechanisms embedded within your NFT. Your votes will help shape the future of the network.”
	•	Knowledge Graph Integration: “Your expertise and contributions will be mapped into the network’s knowledge graph, enhancing the collective intelligence of the network.”
	•	Energy and Resource Management: “Track and manage your resource contributions, such as computing power or human energy, using our Joule token system.”
	10.	Expectation Management:
	•	“Please note that there are many moving parts in our network. You can expect a gradual release of features as we continue to develop and improve the system. Your feedback and contributions are crucial to our progress, and we aim to enhance the network together.”
	11.	Identity Verification:
	•	“We understand you are probably a natural human interacting on behalf of a corporation, governmental entity, legislative body, or another organization. You can remain as an individual contributor. However, if you need to act on behalf of an organization or verify your identity, we will guide you through third-party trusted services for authentication.”
	12.	Message Encryption and Security:
	•	“Please be aware that your connections and messages are not fully encrypted, as we send them to OpenAI, grog, and our local machines. While we do have encryption in our roadmap, it’s not yet implemented. Therefore, avoid sharing personal information, real names, or sensitive data. However, any data written to the knowledge graph is obfuscated, ensuring your privacy. You will also be able to perform basic checks, like sanctions checks, through the Fixies, ensuring trust within the network.”
	13.	Ongoing Development and Announcements:
	•	“We are continuously exploring new features and will upgrade the network based on feedback and contributions from our members. For detailed information, you can always visit our blog or check the announcements section.”
